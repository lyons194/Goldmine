#GOLDMINE OVERVIEW

"""

**LONG DESCRIPTION:

Goldmine is a game of chance.  The game takes place over the course of seven days.  On each day, you, the user, must decide whether or not to enter the "goldmine".  If the user enters the mine, they have a chance to find certain treasures, but they also run the risk of encountering certain dangers by entering the mine.

The user is trapped in this setting and must mine enough gold to buy a plane ticket home.  It is a game of survival and surprises!

The user can find gold when they enter the mine, but that is not guaranteed.  In fact, there are a plethora of other things, creatures, and events that can happen to the user when they enter the mine.  The user can have positive experiences that are unrelated to the gold they may or may not collect on any given day\round, and the user can also have negative experiences that can be unrelated to the gold they may or may not collect on any given day\round.

The program will determine whether the user wins the game by keeping a tally of all of the things that occur to the user.  The user has has the potential to gain 'points' by entering the mine.  However, by entering the mine, the user may also lose points, or incur negative points, due to the potential hazards that exist within the mine.  A user will gain points if they are lucky enough to have a successful day working in the mine.

If the user gains a sufficient amount of points (threshold TBD), then they will be granted the opportunity to buy a plane ticket and fly home.

**Future drafts of this program will feature an element of strategy as well.  Until then, Goldmine will remain a game of chance.
